Automated Testing with Cypress and Cucumber BDD
This repository contains automated tests for the project using Cypress in combination with Cucumber BDD (Behavior-Driven Development). 
The tests are written in Gherkin syntax and executed using Cypress, a fast and reliable testing framework for web applications.
Key Features:
Cypress: An end-to-end testing framework that runs directly in the browser.
Cucumber BDD: A behavior-driven testing approach where tests are written in natural language using Gherkin syntax.
Gherkin Syntax: Allows collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders by writing test scenarios in a readable format.
